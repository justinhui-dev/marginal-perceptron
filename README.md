# Marginal Perceptron

Introduction
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Marginal Perceptron algorithm, a linear classifier used for binary classification tasks. The Marginal Perceptron algorithm is a variant of the classic Perceptron algorithm that computes the margin between decision boundaries to improve classification performance.

# Features
Python Implementation: Developed from scratch in Python, providing a clear and understandable implementation of the Marginal Perceptron algorithm.
Binary Classification: Supports binary classification tasks where instances belong to one of two classes.
Margin Calculation: Computes the margin between decision boundaries to enhance classification accuracy and robustness.
Simple Interface: Offers a straightforward interface for training the classifier and making predictions on new data.
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/marginal-perceptron.git
Navigate to the cloned directory:

bash
Copy code
cd marginal-perceptron
Use the marginal_perceptron.py module in your Python code:

python
Copy code
from marginal_perceptron import MarginalPerceptron

# Initialize the Marginal Perceptron classifier
classifier = MarginalPerceptron()

# Train the classifier on your training data
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on new data
predictions = classifier.predict(X_test)
Review the performance of the classifier and adjust parameters as needed.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
